## Overview

**Text Forge** is a lightweight, modular code editor designed for flexibility and control. Its mode-driven design, customizable interface, and support for GDScript scripting make it easy to create a personalized editing environment.

Language-agnostic and suitable for any text format, Text Forge features a data-driven, object-oriented architecture. Its plug-and-play system lets you extend functionality without touching the core.
